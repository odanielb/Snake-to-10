Instructions: Run the "snake_driver.py" file to play the game! Follow the directions on screen.

Purpose: It's a game of Snake written in Python (which I personally think is an excellent pun)--what more of a purpose does it need? Actually, this was my final project for my CSC 226 Software Design & Implementation class. It is made from scratch completely by me.
